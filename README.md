## 📑 Summary

## Inspiration


## What it does


## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
We weren't able to interact with the hardware equipment in person which led to real limitations. We tackled this by using an SSH server to connect to the jetson nano and this allowed us to access the camera to test the object detection model. Furthermore we remotely collaborated on the arduino code.     
Quick communication was also one of the challenges as we had to reboot the server a couple of times so we were always active on discord and ensured we rebooted the server when no-one was in the midst of coding.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was a hardware project in a fully online setting so we are really proud of being able to procure the parts needed and assemble them in quick time as well as incorporating, testing and debugging the object detection model.

## What we learned
We learnt how to use OpenCV and CUDA it was a steep learning curve as we were not familiar with it.


## What's next for Bird_Up!
We are planning on adding more predator and hazards classes to our model to make the system more robust.
